# AI Cinematic Prompt

**Language:** [中文](README.md) | English

中文用户请看：[README.md](README.md)

An image-only cinematic prompt skill for AI agents. It generates HBO / prestige-TV / Hollywood-grade image prompts and LOOK transfer prompts for still-image generation.

If this project helps you, please give it a Star. It helps more creators and Agent builders discover the skill.

## What It Does

- Generates cinematic text-to-image prompts.
- Transfers a cinematographic LOOK onto a different scene.
- Uses DP-inspired presets, camera/lens/light/color parameters, and a tiered anti-slop system.
- Supports fuzzy style requests through a LOOK CARD confirmation step.
- Adapts still-image prompts for GPT Image, Flux, and Midjourney by controlling noise-fuse terms, photographic realism, clean shadows, and tonal density.

## Latest Update: v0.3.0

This release upgrades fog, volumetric-light, and spatial-depth handling. The skill
now selects a depth mechanism from light/exposure separation, distance-graded
atmospheric perspective, or occlusion and scale recession instead of applying
generic haze to create depth.

- Atmospheric perspective reduces distant contrast and color separation while preserving silhouettes, edges, and background structure.
- Fog, smoke, dust, steam, and visible light shafts require a plausible medium plus a motivated source, direction, and falloff.
- Vacuum space and clean sealed environments no longer receive automatic atmospheric haze or suspended particles.
- Depth language follows subject priority and a softening budget, preventing subject dilution and smeared backgrounds.

See [CHANGELOG.md](CHANGELOG.md) for the complete technical changes.

### Other Agent Runtimes

Clone this repository into the runtime's skills directory, keeping `SKILL.md` at the skill root:

```text
<your-agent-skills-dir>/cinematic-prompt-engine/SKILL.md
```

## Usage

Mention the skill by name, or describe a cinematic still-image prompt task.

Single image prompt:

```text
[$cinematic-prompt-engine] Generate a Succession-style cinematic image prompt: a woman walking alone toward her car in a rainy parking lot at night.
```

LOOK transfer:

```text
[$cinematic-prompt-engine] Use the dune_arrakis LOOK to shoot a futuristic temple in morning fog.
```

Fuzzy style direction:

```text
[$cinematic-prompt-engine] Cyberpunk night scene, a courier standing under an abandoned overpass. Give me a LOOK CARD first.
```

The skill will generate a full prompt directly when a preset is clear. If the style is fuzzy, it will propose a LOOK CARD first and wait for confirmation.

## Demo Gallery

See [demo/README.md](demo/README.md) for example images covering neon portraits, monumental worlds, dragon-scale fantasy, and grounded space suspense.
